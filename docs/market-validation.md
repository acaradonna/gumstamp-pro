# Market validation (abridged)

- Gumroad provides basic PDF stamping (buyer email + Gumroad logo).
- Creators often want brand-forward, configurable stamping and stronger deterrents.
- Technical feasibility: Gumroad Ping webhook provides sale data to precompute or on-demand stamp; delivery is via secure tokenized link hosted here.
- Competition: generic watermark tools exist; a Gumroad-focused, automated, branded solution is scarce.
- Pricing hypothesis: $5–$19/mo light tier; $29–$49/mo pro tier; or $0.10–$0.50 per stamped download at scale.

Assumptions and risks are tracked in `docs/notes.md`.
